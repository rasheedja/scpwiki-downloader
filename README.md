# scpwiki-downloader
Downloads every existing SCP page from www.scp-wiki.net. Extra pages like the scp-001 proposals
or the SCP-093 Tests will not be downloaded as of now.

To use this, install python 3.4 and run scpwiki-downloader.py. This script takes
some time to run as it will download every SCP page from 001 to 2999.
